# SoundCortex
A firmware that makes your LPC810 work as a historical sound chip

## What's this?
Firmware that makes your LPC810 work like a PSG, AY-3-8910. But all registers can be accessible via I2C.

## Schematic
[![Schematic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toyoshim/SoundCortex/master/schem.png "Schematic")](https://upverter.com/toyoshim/564092a49959599c/I2CBridge/)

This contains RC LPF that consists from 680Î© register and 0.01uF capasitor. Cut-off frequency of the filter is about 23.4kHz.
You might be able to connect it to mixer without them, but please do it at your own risk. If you ain't lucky enough, your equipments will be damaged.

## How to build
This repository includes prebiult binaries under Release/ directory, but also you can build it by yourself with the LPCXpresso project files included in this repository too.
You need to import CMSIS_CORE_LPX8xx and lpc800_driver_lib from <lpcxpresso>/Examples/Legacy/NXP/LPC800/LPC8xx_Libraries.zip to use these libraries.

If you are using MCUXpresso, select 'Import...' from the popup menu, and import this project by 'General > Existing Projects into Workspace'. Dependent libraries can be imported as a project archive, via 'Import project(s) from file system...' menu. Library should exist in <mcuxpresso>/ide/Examples/... .

## How to use
You can access to the chip through I2C bus.
The slave address is 0x50, and you can write two bytes data to write to internal registers.
The first byte is the register address, and the second byte is data to write.
Internal register map is compatible with AY-3-8910.

If you want to use from PC, you may need something that allows your PC to send I2C transactions.
You may be interested in [I2CBridge](https://github.com/toyoshim/I2CBridge) that converts USART serial to I2C.

If you want to use Raspberry Pi, you can just use built-in I2C. [Here](https://youtu.be/buaCriXYXNY) is a demo movie that controls the chip from Raspberry Pi.
